Hello, dear reader. I made this little "game" a long time ago (around 2015-2016) while learing basic functions of C# and WinForms.

This is a simple cycling through program to help the user aquire new words in English (or any other langugage).
To make it work you have to compile an exe file. After you do it, you need to place "english_prog_files" folder from repository to the same location as exe file.

You can delete those words or add some new words via program tools.

Probably works only on Windows PC.

Have fun.
